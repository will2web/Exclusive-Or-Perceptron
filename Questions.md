-FOR GEMINI:


-FOR RESEARCH
I still want to confirm why I had to do .items() to write to file instead of the .writer()
How do I automatically print the names of variables (probably @Name())?

-FOR EXPERIMENTING
Did I need to save the weights array to a struct in order to stringify them into a JSON format?
