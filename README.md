Simply implementing a basic neural network, from scratch - although often by "hand-translating" Python versions - In order to become more familiar with the Zig language, the basics of AI & Github itself.

My next little project, which I'm going to be testing on this neural network,is a zig script that goes over zig files themselves and analyzes how big variables need to actually be; for example do I really need a float 32 or can I get with a float 4, or even some kind of int?

I'm not sure if I want to Do this variable analyze certain next, or save my weights to file so I can use the perceptron for real..
